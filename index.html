                <p>“There were several reasons why I chose to study at Gullem University and glad that 
                    I am a graduate of Gullem University now. 
                    The teachers are well experienced, friendly and helpful. 
                    The small class sizes let you have one on one interaction with your 
                    teachers and you can literally be friends with everyone in the class. 
                    Gullem University also organises various professional, networking and career workshops, 
                    which help students to identify their potential and improve networking skills. 
                    Gullem University helped me in understanding different cultures and in 
                    improving my soft skills through presentations and group assignments. 
                    As a fresh graduate of Gullem University, 
                    I am pleased to be part of Gullem University alumni, so I could give back to my alma mater. 
                    Students can surely rely on Gullem University for a promising future.”</p>

                <p>“Gullem University is nationally and internationally recognized for 
                    its achievements in the education sector in Australia. Gullem University has a mixture of students 
                    from a diverse range of backgrounds and is located in the heart of Melbourne CBD at a 
                    walking distance from Melbourne Central station. The professors are really friendly and 
                    willing to help students to go that extra mile in their educational journey. 
                    I was able to get the right help from my teachers and this helped me to get an award 
                    for academic excellence at the graduation ceremony in 2017. For those students who 
                    are keen to achieve more, I would highly recommend Gullem University. They will experience a real 
                    change in their academic achievements. With my unforgettable experience at MIT, I am 
                    grateful that I still get to be in touch with Gullem University as one of the alumni.”</p>
